<p>
This package contains the framework for building configuration applications.  There are two main classes 
that must be implemented to use this framework.  One is a single class that is the subject of the management, the
other is a command factory and the commands (more on that in a moment).
</p>
<p>
The framework is arranged with a CommandSource pushing Command objects on a queue and a CommandProcessor popping
commands from the queue and executing.  The CommandSource references a CommandFactory to build command instances
from the native form supported by the CommandSource.
Both the CommandSource and the CommandProcessor can run on worker threads or on a single thread.  By default,
the CommandSource runs on the calling thread and the CommandProcessor runs on a worker thread.
The CommandController is responsible for connecting the source and the processor to the processing queue and for
starting threads and/or running the source and processor run methods.
</p>
<p>
Default implementations are provided for the queue, the CommandSource and the CommandProcessor.  Implementation of
the CommandFactory, the Command derivations and the subject class are application specific.  A base CommandFactory
implementation is provided.
The default CommandSource takes its input from standard in, so simple command line applications require little
framework code. 
</p>
<p>
A complete application (e.g. the VIX cache configuration utility) is constructed something like:

	public static void main(String[] argv)
	{
		...
		try
		{
			CacheManagerImpl cacheManager = CacheManagerImpl.getSingleton();
			CommandFactory commandFactory = InteractiveCacheCommandFactoryImpl.getSingleton();
			CommandController<CacheManagerImpl> icc = new CommandController<CacheManagerImpl>(cacheManager, commandFactory);
			
			icc.getCommandSource().pushCommands(argv);
			icc.run();
		}
		catch (Exception x)
		{
			x.printStackTrace();
			return;
		}
	}
